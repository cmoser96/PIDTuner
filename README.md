# PIDTuner

## Linearity 2 Final Project

### Proposal
For our project, we would like to model an inverted pendulum that will start in an arbitrary starting point and move to the unstable equalibrium using PID control. We want to choose some P, I, and D values and model them so we can plot them and do a regression. Then we will gradient descent on that regression, to find what we hope to be the optimal combination of values.

### Goals
- Model an inverted pendulum
- Have the base of the pendulum move
- Test out different P, I, and D values
- Plot the values and do a regression
- Gradient descent of the regression
